<p>xCCK is a kind of general-purpose database module, which is an acronym for XOOPS Cube Contents Creation Kit.</p>
<p>It is a new generation universal module that fully utilizes the functions of XOOPS Cube Legacy 2.2.
You can freely design items as much as you like, and by linking with common module groups such as parent-child pages, sub-table settings, and categories, even those who cannot program can realize desired functions.
</p>
<p>You can flexibly create basic web applications that store and display data, and can be used for static content, news, product catalogs, image albums, blogs, links, and more.</p>
